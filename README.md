# Anime Recommendation System
The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a transformative shift in daily life, with lockdowns and social distancing measures prompting a surge in demand for online entertainment. Amid this surge, anime, a dynamic and diverse form of animated entertainment originating in Japan, became a captivating source of solace and diversion. Its captivating storytelling and artistic expression, free from language barriers, resonated with a global audience. As viewers turned to online streaming platforms, the challenge of offering personalized recommendations for anime content emerged. Anime enthusiasts sought fresh and engaging content tailored to their unique preferences. This research endeavors to address this challenge by harnessing big data concepts. Our research begins by ingesting and storing data in the resilient Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), ensuring scalability and fault tolerance. Subsequently, PySpark is employed to process the data, encompassing vital tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and format standardization, including addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and establishing data uniformity. To create a comprehensive and engaging user experience, Tableau is utilized for data visualization, enabling the development of dynamic dashboards and visualizations. These tools not only showcase recommendation results but also provide insights into user engagement metrics. At the core of our research lies the implementation of collaborative filtering algorithms, making use of PySpark's machine-learning libraries to extract valuable insights from the processed data. By considering a user's viewing history, ratings, and preferences, we aim to provide personalized anime suggestions that transcend language barriers, enriching the streaming experience. In an era characterized by evolving media consumption habits and a growing desire for cross-cultural content, our research seeks to bridge the gap between entertainment and technology. It aims to provide a tailored streaming experience that empowers users to explore, enjoy, and connect with anime in a personalized and meaningful way.
